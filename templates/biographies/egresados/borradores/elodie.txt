After a five year degree in Law and travels across Australia and Asia, I desired to specialized in Environmental Conservation. I completed a Master's degree in Management and Conservation of Species in Trade, in Spain.

     Rodrigo Medellin and Mercedes Nu√±ez Roman supported my study and research on Recommendations for the establishment and operation of holding facilities for confiscated live animals in France. The objective of the thesis was to make recommendations to improve the management of confiscated live animals. More specifically, the study was designed to develop an understanding of the important role that holding and quarantine facilities play in the protection of biodiversity in general and the impact of international trade law. The assessment led me to take contact with many actors involved in this field from public Authorities to NGO in Europe.

Interests

My passion for animal conservation led me to join several Organizations across Asia and Australia during two years with particular interests on elephant protection and marine area conservation. My diving certification completed in Thailand allowed me to have a hands-on approach to learn about the coral reef environment and a wide range of research and restoration techniques.
