 Born and raised in Charleston, SC, Rosalyn Morrison was always interested in the welfare of animals and became a vegetarian herself at the young age of 12. After high school, she moved to Nice, France and lived with a host family for a year to learn French. While at Clemson University, she spent a semester in Brussels attending ICHEC University and taking courses in international trade and business. She received a grant to study Russian language and culture in St. Petersburg. Morrison graduated Cum Laude from Clemson University with a degree in French and International Trade and a Minor in Italian.

     Seeking another perspective of the world, Morrison moved to South Korea, and upon learning about the dog meat trade, she made it her mission to campaign against the egregious dog meat trade in Asia. After two years in Korea, Morrison moved to Washington, DC, to work at the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), where she educated the public through grassroots activism throughout the nation and through lobbying federal U.S. policymakers to urge South Korea to ban the trade and Philippines officials to enforce its current ban and rabies law. She organized an International Day of Action for South Korean Dogs and Cats on August 7, 2012, attracting over 70 participants, including celebrities, to help raise awareness in the U.S.

     While at the Animal Welfare Institute, Morrison attended the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP 16) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). She developed an interest in international wildlife trade at the CoP and is now pursuing her Master’s Degree in the Management and Conservation of Species in Trade at the Universidad Internacional de Andalucía (UNIA) in Baeza, Spain. She is writing her thesis on the legal and illegal trade of pangolins in Southeast Asia.
